# mpOS
*the home repository of the fake OS written in C , made to simulate a real operating system*
*curenttly in development, most things like the bootloader or kernel are done, but apps are still in development*


*there are two files, one `makefile` for Linux/BSD/MacOS and one `CMakeLists.txt` for windows*

*requires: GCC or Clang*
*CMake (if on windows), Make (if on Unix)

***The `ccosc/` dir is legacy code, use `mpOS/` dir

# building
*from source*
1. git clone the repo
2. make sure you have GCC or Clang and Cmake
3. run `build.sh`
